# Notes for IFC 5

## Notes

- The customdata node in the schema is not like the other industrial standards or schemas such as USD schema. It is a custom schema defined by users or developers.

## Issues

- I can't find the schema file which said to be located at ifc5.technical.buildingsmart.org/schemas/bsi/ifc/v5a/schema.json
